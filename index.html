			<h2>Subtheme: Corporate Landlords &amp; Evictions</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Does the spatial concentration of corporate property acquisitions correlate with the
							demographic exclusion of Black and Hispanic communities, or is capital targeting specific
							"transitioning" neighborhoods?</strong></p>
					<p>Prior to beginning the visual analysis, I intend to map the geographic footprint of corporate
						landlords to determine whether they are disproportionately acquiring properties in Black,
						Hispanic, and Asian communities. This motivation stems from the "Homes for All Massachusetts"
						report, which starkly illustrates the severe racial inequities in eviction filings across
						municipalities like Boston and Brockton. The report demonstrates that evictions are not random
						occurrences but highly targeted spatial phenomena. Furthermore, the New York Times investigation
						into 83 million eviction records emphasizes the sweeping, intimate devastation this crisis
						inflicts upon families. I aim to investigate whether corporate landlords act as the primary
						spatial drivers of these neighborhood-level displacements, thereby systematically reshaping the
						demographic and cultural fabric of the city.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Are corporate investors systematically targeting and removing multi-family housing
							typologies—specifically Boston's historic two-family and three-family residences—from the
							local ownership market?</strong></p>
					<p>Historically, the "triple-decker" was uniquely designed as a crucial mechanism for working-class
						wealth building, functioning to offer affordable, multi-generational living within a compact
						urban footprint. The New York Times piece discusses how the commodification of housing alters
						communities at a fundamental structural level. By analyzing the property types and bedroom
						counts associated with these real estate transactions, I seek to ascertain if the architectural
						"missing middle" is being monopolized. If corporate entities are dominating the acquisition of
						these specific structures, they are fundamentally subverting the original architectural purpose
						of Boston's housing stock, transforming community-sustaining residences into purely speculative
						financial assets.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>To what extent do predatory market tactics, such as rapid property flipping and
							intentional "warehousing," restrict the available housing supply and exacerbate neighborhood
							instability?</strong></p>
					<p>This inquiry bridges the disciplines of urban economics and urban planning. Both the eviction
						data highlighted in the New York Times and the structural inequalities detailed in the "Homes
						for All" report point to a housing market ecosystem that prioritizes capital accumulation over
						residential stability. From a planning perspective, a vacant building signifies both a
						neighborhood blight and a failure of spatial utilization. I am motivated to examine the
						correlation between high corporate ownership rates and localized vacancy rates. If institutional
						investors are intentionally leaving buildings empty to artificially inflate neighborhood rents
						or facilitate future flipping, it represents a manufactured scarcity that directly fuels the
						ongoing eviction crisis.</p>

					owner-occupancy rate exhibits a gradual but persistent decline. Notably, the data reveals a critical
					threshold crossed in 2023, where the aggregate corporate-owned rate surpassed the owner-occupancy
					rate citywide.

					we can see that a higher corporate ownership rate is oppositely correlated with a higher minority

				<h2>Summary</h2>

				<p>The data illustrates a significant transformation in Boston’s housing market, characterized by a
					steady rise in corporate ownership that culminated in 2023 when the citywide corporate-owned rate
					officially surpassed the owner-occupancy rate. This trend accelerated following the onset of the
					COVID-19 pandemic, with corporate control now heavily concentrated in areas like the South Boston
					Waterfront and Downtown. Yet, a higher corporate ownership rates are currently found in
					neighborhoods
					with higher minority populations, and the corporate ownership rate is not positively
					correlated with Black and Latino communities.

				</p>

				<p>Visual analysis debunked several hypotheses regarding predatory market tactics, specifically the idea
					that investors are monopolizing the "missing middle" or intentionally "warehousing" units. The data
					reveals that historic two-family and three-family residences, known as "triple-deckers," are not
					dominated by corporate buyers but remain largely under individual ownership. Furthermore, there is
					no evidence of "manufactured scarcity" through intentional vacancies, as vacancy rates do not rise
					significantly alongside increases in corporate ownership. These findings suggest that while
					corporate expansion is a reality, it has not yet overtaken the specific architectural typologies
					historically used for working-class wealth building.
				</p>

				<p> Despite the lack of evidence for warehousing, the human toll of corporate dominance remains high, as
					majority-nonwhite neighborhoods face disproportionately higher eviction threats. Across
					Massachusetts, 43% of all eviction filings occurred in majority-nonwhite neighborhoods, even though
					these areas account for only 32% of the rental housing stock. Research indicates that landlords with
					a local stake, such as live-in owners, file significantly fewer evictions for non-payment or cause
					compared to absentee corporate entities. Consequently, the transition toward corporate control
					likely exacerbates the regional eviction crisis by replacing community-sustaining residences with
					speculative assets that prioritize capital accumulation over residential stability.</p>
